For each study, the raw inquisit data files (xlsx files in the `data/raw` folder) were processed into a SPSS .sav files by Sean/Simone. This was done manually/in SPSS and no code/syntax to reproduce this processing is available, although it was carefully rechecked in each case. 

The processing.Rmd file in the analysis folder converts all these .sav files first to .csv format (which are saved to the `data/processed` folders in each experiment) as "data_spss_converted_to_csv.csv". This processing.Rmd script then tidied each data file's names and applied the exclusion criteria. Each experiment's to-be-analyzed data was then saved to the `data/processed` folder as data_for_analysis.csv.
